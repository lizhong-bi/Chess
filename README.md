# Chess
A two player chess game which I have created in the summer of 2016 using OOP, specifically Java. Initially, provides an interface for players to have fun on, allowing player to see the position of all captures and the capture history, and with wrong move detection enforcing the players to make the correct moves for the piece they would like to move.
Is currently revising the code to make it more proficient and along with working on a chess engine allowing single player mode to open up for players and different difficulty levels to provice players with challanges.
